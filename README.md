##DESCRIPTION##

MILEZ is an innovative Web3 platform designed to incentivize eco-friendly transportation choices by rewarding individuals for using public transportation. In a world where transportation contributes significantly to carbon emissions, MILEZ bridges the gap between sustainability and personal reward, encouraging users to adopt greener habits while enjoying tangible benefits.

MILEZ tracks the distance traveled by users on public transportation. For every certain kilometer covered, users earn carbon credits in form of $MILEZ token. $MILEZ can be redeemed for exclusive merchandise, or even converted into USDT (future feature), offering both flexibility and value.

What sets MILEZ apart is its transparency and security, powered by blockchain technology. Every transaction is traceable and verifiable, ensuring users can trust the system. Beyond individual rewards, MILEZ contributes to the global carbon credit market, allowing businesses and organizations to offset their emissions while supporting sustainable practices.

Join MILEZ and turn your daily commute into a greener, rewarding journey! Together, we can drive the change toward a more sustainable planet.
